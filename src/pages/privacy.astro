                    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the SUDX project ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with your use of the sudx.xyz website (the "Site").</p>

                    <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
                    <p>We do not require you to create an account or provide any personally identifiable information (PII) to use our Site. We do not collect names, email addresses, physical addresses, or other similar contact information.</p>

                    <h2>2. Information We Collect Automatically</h2>
                    <p>Like most websites, we use third-party services to automatically collect anonymous data about your visit to help us understand how our Site is being used and to improve our services.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to collect anonymous traffic data, such as the pages you visit, the duration of your visit, your general geographic location (e.g., country or city), and the type of device and browser you are using. This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify you personally. For more information, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how Google uses data</a>.</li>
                        <li><strong>Vercel Speed Insights & Analytics:</strong> Our Site is hosted on Vercel, which may collect anonymous performance metrics and analytics to help us monitor and improve the user experience.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>3. Web3 and Blockchain Interactions</h2>
                    <p>Our Site includes features that allow you to interact with the Polygon blockchain.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Connecting Your Wallet:</strong> When you choose to connect a third-party Web3 wallet (like MetaMask), our Site receives your public wallet address. We do not store this address, but it is used for the duration of your session to display your connection status and enable on-chain interactions (like donations). Your wallet address is public information on the blockchain.</li>
                        <li><strong>Transactions:</strong> All transactions you initiate, such as donations, are recorded on the Polygon blockchain. This data is public, permanent, and not controlled by us.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
                    <p>We do not set our own cookies. However, third-party services like Google Analytics may use cookies to function correctly. You can control or delete cookies through your browser settings.</p>

                    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
                    <p>We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. While we do not collect personal data, we take reasonable measures to protect the integrity of our Site and the anonymous data we collect.</p>

                    <h2>6. Third-Party Links</h2>
                    <p>Our Site contains links to third-party websites and services, such as Telegram, X (Twitter), GitHub, and QuickSwap. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage you to read their privacy policies.</p>

                    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
                    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this page periodically.</p>
