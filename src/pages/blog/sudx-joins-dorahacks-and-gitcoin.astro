                    <h1>SUDX Expands its Mission: Now on DoraHacks and Gitcoin!</h1>
                    <p><em>Published on August 2, 2025</em></p>

                    <p>The SUDX journey is all about turning community gratitude into tangible, sustainable funding for the open-source software that powers our world. Today, we are thrilled to announce two major steps forward in bringing this vision to a wider audience of builders, developers, and advocates for a free and open internet.</p>

                    <h2>1. SUDX is now on DoraHacks!</h2>
                    <p>We have officially listed our project on DoraHacks, the global hub for Web3 developers and BUIDLers. This platform allows us to showcase SUDX to a community that lives and breathes innovation. Itâ€™s a place to connect with contributors, gather feedback, and demonstrate our commitment to building real tools for the open-source ecosystem.</p>
                    <p>This isn't just a listing; it's an invitation for hackers and developers to explore our mission and join us in shaping the future of FOSS funding.</p>

                    <h2>2. Introducing SUDX to the Gitcoin Community</h2>
                    <p>There is no better place to discuss the future of open-source funding than Gitcoin, a pioneer in the space. We have started a conversation on the Gitcoin Governance Forum to introduce SUDX to its incredible community.</p>
                    <p>Our goal is to engage in a meaningful dialogue, share our unique approach, and align with those who have long championed the cause of public goods. We believe that collaboration is key, and we are eager to hear from the community that helped start it all.</p>

                    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>
                    <p>Listing on these platforms is more than just a marketing step. It is a strategic move to place SUDX at the heart of the communities we aim to serve. It increases our visibility, enhances our credibility, and, most importantly, opens up new channels for collaboration and community growth.</p>
                    
                    <h3><code>sudo join community</code></h3>
                    <p>Our mission is ambitious, but the path is clear. We are building the bridge between the collaborative ethos of open source and the financial power of Web3. We invite you to be a part of this journey.</p>
